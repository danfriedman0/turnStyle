# turnStyle

turnStyle is an extension for Google Chrome that lets you change the style of web pages. You should be able to write your own style for any web page and save it so that your style will load whenever you visit that site.

Right now the intended use is for web sites that don't specify any style at all. You'll get weird results if you try to restyle websites that already have robust stylesheets.
